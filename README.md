# ReactProject

In this repository I have created few Apps using React. 


#### Increcounter:  An app that has a button with a number starting with 0 displayed in the text of the button.

	- When the user clicks on it, the text in button increase the value by 1



#### Counter_2:  Two buttons with a label in between that displays a numeric value starting with 0

	- The button the left decreases the value buy 1 

	- The button on the right increases the value by 1

	- When the value is a negative number the text of the label is red

	- When the value is a positive number the text of the label is green



#### suggestions: Created a autocomplete component:

	- Hardcoded some countries in to a list-like data structure 

	- Consist of an input text box where the user enters characters

	- It has UI component that filters and suggests a list of the words from the list that was hardcoded that includes the characters the user typed in

	- This is a standard autocomplete component



####  reactapi: Web API - 	

	- A web api that returns Country's Names and Capitals data in JSON format. I used a free API whose end point is ` https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/` 

	- Created a react app with components 

	- Implemented a custom component that takes in the a data structure from the JSON returned by the web api and creates a list of the values on the screen.
